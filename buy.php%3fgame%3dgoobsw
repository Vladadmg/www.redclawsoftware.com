The only thing we ask is that you let us know what your reason is. Not so we can turn around and deny the refund, but so we know what to improve in the future! But to make this fair, please do not request a refund just because you want the game for free. Remember, we work very hard to make these games, and have bills to pay just like everyone else. Thanks for understanding.</p><p>To request a refund, send an email to <b>refund@redclawsoftware.com</b> including your name, email address, and reason for the refund.</p></BODY></HTML>');
