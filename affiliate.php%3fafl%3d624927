			<b>Question: Do I have to have a games related website to be an affiliate?</b> No. In fact most of our affiliates have non games related websites. The only sites which can't participate are those with adult or illegal content.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Question: When someone buys a game, how do you know they came from my site?</b> When a visitor follows the link from your site to here, your unique affiliate ID is passed to our website. This ID is then automatically embedded in all the links on the Redclaw Software website, so as the person moves through the site, the ID stays with them. The ID is also embedded in any game demos the person downloads, meaning if they click on the buy links within the game, the ID is once again passed back to us. Lastly, a cookie containing your ID is also set so that if the person comes back in the future, your ID is still with them. Once you have joined the affiliate program you can test this yourself. Simply follow your own link from your website to here, and notice how wherever you go, your ID is always present in the url. 
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Question: What if someone doesn't buy right away, and comes back to your website later?</b> Your affiliate ID embedded in the game demos and set in the cookie will ensure that whenever the person returns, either from within a game demo or simply by browsing to the site, your affiliate ID will still be there.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Question: How do I know when someone buys a game?</b> There is an automated email system in place for the affiliates, meaning you will immediately receive an email whenever someone places an order. Your affiliate account also comes with a full order history database, allowing you to track your sales over time.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Question: How do I receive my commission payments?</b> The commission payments are handled by BMT Micro. The default method of payment is via check, sent out at quarterly intervals. However other methods &amp; times of payment are available by contacting BMT Micro through your affiliate account.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Question: Do I have to host any extra files on my webspace?</b> No. All you have to do is put your <a href="http://www.redclawsoftware.com/affiliate2.php?afl=624927">custom affiliate link</a> on your site. If you decide to use an image link, the image will be read from our high speed server meaning you won't use any extra bandwidth.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Question: Is there any minimum period I have to join the affiliate program for?</b> No. You can leave the affiliate program at any time you wish.
			<br><br><br>
			<b>Question: Will I have to provide any customer support for any games I sell?</b> No. All customer support requests, including any order queries, are handled by redclaw software.
