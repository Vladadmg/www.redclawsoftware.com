	<b class="title">The Redclaw Software Online Buying Guide</b>
	<br>
	Never bought online before? Unsure what to do? Concerned about safety?
	<br>
	This guide will take you through the simple, easy steps involved in buying a game online from the Redclaw Software store.
	<br><br><br><br>
	<b class="title">Step 1: Choosing Your Games</b>
	<table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td>
	<img align="right" src="gfx/guide1.gif" width="300" height="231">This table shows a list of all the games on offer, and also the option of buying the games on a cdrom. The table consists of two basic elements:
	<br><br>
	<b class="red">A:</b>These are the order boxes. Simply tick (click with the mouse) the box for each game you wish to buy.
	<br><br>
	<b class="red">B:</b>Once you have chosen your games, press the green Continue button to move to the final order screen.
	</td></tr></table>
	<br><br><br><br>	
	<b class="title">Step 2: Placing Your Order</b>
	<table width="100%" border="0"><tr><td>
	<img src="gfx/guide2.gif" width="307" height="532" align="right">If you have chosen to buy online (<i>recommended</i>) you will be taken to our <b>secure</b> order page. What makes the page secure is the fact that any information you enter into the order form is automatically encrypted when the order is placed. This means that no-one but our order processing system can see your details, making the information completely safe.
	<br><br>
	The following information is required when placing an order:
	<br><br>
	<b class="red">A:</b>Your name &amp; contact information.
	<br>
	This information is required by law when receiving a credit card order online. This helps us to tell that the order is valid, and gives us the means to contact you in the unlikey event that there is a problem with your order.
	<br><br>
	<b class="red">B:</b>Your email address.
	<br>
	This is <b>very</b> important! When you place an order, this is the address where we will send the download links for your games, along with an order receipt. If you enter your email address incorrectly, then you won't receive your games, so be sure to double check that the address is correct. 
	<br><br>
	<b class="red">C:</b>Your credit card details.
	<br>
	Choose your credit card type from the drop down list, and enter the relevant numbers into the boxes. If you do not know your credit card security code (the three or four digits on your credit card), click on the blue "<i>Don't know your security code? Click here!</i>" link for a helpful guide on how to find it.
	<br><br>
	Finally, to place your order just click the <b>Send Order</b> button at the bottom of the page. Online orders are processed immediately, and in less than ten minutes you will receive your email receipt and download links for the games. Additionally, if you ordered a CdRom, you will receive confirmation that this will be shipped out to you.

	<b class="title">Frequently Asked Questions</b>
	<br><br>
	<b>"I don't live in America or use American dollars. Can I still order?"</b>
	<br>
	Yes. Although the prices are listed in US dollars, you can place a credit card order from anywhere in the world, and the currency will automatically be converted for you. In fact many of our orders are from non American countries.
	<br><br>
	<b>Do I really have to include my telephone number on the order page?</b>
	<br>
	Yes. In the unlikely event that there is a problem with your order, we will attempt to contact you via email. If, and only if, this is unsuccessful, we will contact you by phone to resolve the problem. But since the <u>vast</u> majority of orders go through without a problem, the chance of you being called on the phone is very, very small.	
	<br><br>
	<b>What if I buy the game and it doesn't work?</b>
	<br>
	We offer playable demos of all of our games which allow you to test the games prior to purchase. However, in the unlikely event that you have a problem running the game (ie, the demo worked on your office computer, but the full game doesn't work on your home computer) we offer a 30 day money back guarantee on all games.
	<br><br>
	<b>How long does it take for me to receive the game(s) I ordered?</b>
	<br>
	Most orders are processed automatically, meaning you will receive the download links for your games in just a few minutes. However, occasionally an order will have to be processed manually, usually because a customer has entered something incorrectly on the order form. In these cases, the order is processed by hand and can take up to 24 hours (though usually much less) to complete.
	<br><br>
	<b>Will you give my information to other companies?</b>
	<br>
	Absolutely not! We really value your custom, and the last thing we would do is annoy you and break your trust in us by passing your information on to other companies. When you place an order with us, your contact information is stored in our private order database, and is <u>never</u> shared with any other company. 
	<br><br>
	<b>Is it really safe to use my credit card online?</b>
	<br>
	If you are buying from Redclaw Software, then the answer is <u><b>YES!</b></u> Thanks to our order processing partner, BMT Micro, we use industrial strength protection, encryption, and fraud detection systems similar to those that a large financial institution might use. This highly specialised system is monitored 24 hours a day by highly skilled software engineers to ensure your information is completely safe.
