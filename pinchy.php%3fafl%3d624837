			<p>Just who is Mr Pinchy? Well apart from being the inspiration for our name and logo, Mr Pinchy was a tropical red clawed crab. More than that, he was <b><i>the</i></b> tropical red clawed crab in a tank of eight.</p>
			<div align="center"><img src="gfx/pinchy.gif" width="257" height="169"></div>
			<p>You see, like a lot of other animals, red clawed crabs have a basic social structure whereby one crab will become dominant, and become "king" of the group. To reach this much coveted position a crab must either beat the current leader in a fight, or make a really funny joke about his pants. Since all these crabs had impeccable fashion sense, Mr Pinchy was left with but one course of action!</p>
			<p>About a month after being put in the tank, Mr Pinchy made his move and went for the current reigning champion in a scene reminiscent of Lewis Vs Tyson. In other words they danced around a lot, waving their arms until one good nip saw the champ running for the nearest cave. Mr Pinchy had won, and it didn't even go to the judges score cards!</p>
			<p>For the next <b>three years</b> (surely some sort of record) Mr Pinchy reigned supreme! And let me tell you, there are plenty of benefits to being King Crab: The best pieces of fish at feeding time, the warmest spot on the basking rock, and lets not forget the attention of all the lady crabs...</p>
			<p>Of course this kind of power comes with a price. And on more than one occasion Mr Pinchy had to defend his crown. Sure he lost a leg here, a leg there, but they always grew back when he shed his skin!</p>
			<p>Sadly, after three years and two months, Mr Pinchy died of natural causes (most likely simple old age) never having lost his place as King of the tank. And though he may be gone, his never-give-up-be-the-best-crab-that-you-can-be spirit is still going strong.</p>
			<p>The Crab</p>
			<p>The King</p>
			<p>The Big Claw</p>
			<p>R.I.P Mr Pinchy.</p>
